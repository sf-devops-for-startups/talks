# talks

We want YOU to come talk or present at a future SF DevOps for Startups event!

Talks must be 15 minutes or less. Our events occur on the first Wednesday of the month--check out our [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/SF-DevOps-for-Startups) for a list of upcoming events.

**To submit an idea**, just [create a new issue](https://github.com/sf-devops-for-startups/talks/issues/new) and fill it out with your details.

> _Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can email me@lamroger.com
